@article{Santoro_1985,
	abstract = {{The routing problem in networks is solved by either maintaining at every node detailed routing information for all destinations (explicit routing) or by exploiting the information implicit in an a-priori labelling of nodes and links (implicit routing). Efficient implicit routing algorithms are known only for networks modelled by graphs having special topologies (e.g. ring, hypercube). In this paper, a labelling scheme for graphs of arbitrary topology is presented, and an implicit routing algorithm is derived. The proposed algorithm is shown to be optimal for acyclic graphs, and to exhibit a worst-case complexity which is within a factor of two from the optimal solution for graphs of arbitrary topology. Limitations to the applicability of the proposed solutions to communication networks are discussed.}},

@inproceedings{Kaplan_2022,
	abstract = {Motivated by a recent application in XML search engines we study the problem of labeling the nodes of a tree (XML file) such that given the labels of two nodes one can determine whether one node is an ancestor of the other. We describe several new prefix-based labeling schemes, where an ancestor query roughly amounts to testing whether one label is a prefix of the other. We compare our new schemes to a simple interval-based scheme currently used by search engines, as well as, to schemes with the best theoretical guarantee on the maximum label length. We performed our experimental evaluation on real XML data and on some families of random trees.},
